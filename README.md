So, this JavaScript code is all about creating a simple text-based slot machine game. Like those casino games where you pull the lever and watch the symbols spin around. Here's what each part of the code does:

Deposit: At the beginning, players can put in some money to start playing. Just like when you buy tokens or credits for a game.

Betting: After putting in the money, players choose how many lines they want to bet on (up to 3) and how much they want to bet for each line. It's like deciding how much you want to risk on each spin.

Spinning: When the player's all set, the slot machine spins its reels. Each reel shows random symbols, creating a kind of mystery about what you're going to get.

Outcome Analysis: The game then checks if the symbols in the rows match up in any special way, like if they're all the same. If they do, the game figures out how much the player could win.

Balance Management: Depending on the bets and outcomes, the player's balance is adjusted. If they win, the balance goes up; if they lose, it goes down.

Display: As the symbols spin and the results come in, the game shows you what symbols are in each row and whether you won or not.

Loop: The fun doesn't stop! The game keeps looping so players can keep betting, spinning, and finding out what happens next. This goes on until they decide to stop or they run out of money to play with.
